# Cut a release. The level is anything cargo-release accepts, so "patch", "minor", "major", or an
# explicit version like "0.12.0". This bumps the version everywhere, stamps the "NEXT" section in
# Changes.md with the version and date, commits, tags, and pushes. Pushing the tag is what makes
# CI build the binaries, publish the crates to crates.io, and draft the GitHub release.
#
# Unlike the other recipes, cargo-release runs on the host rather than in the dev container,
# because the commit and tag are signed and the signing key lives outside the container.
