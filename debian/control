Description: one code quality tool to rule them all
 Precious is a command-line tool to unify
 the execution of source code tidiers and validators.
 .
 With Precious you can configure
 all of your code quality tool rules in one place
 and easily run `precious` from your commit hooks and in CI.
 .
 Several tidier+validator unifiers/orchestraters exists,
 including perl-based TidyAll (the predecessor of Precious),
 Python-based pre-commit,
 Go-based lefthook,
 NodeJS-based husky and lint-staged,
 and Ruby-based overcommit.
 For comparison, Precious is Rust-based with these notable features:
  * handles directory-wide and project-wide tasks
    (unlike TidyAll)
  * stores task settings locally
    (unlike pre-commit)
  * cannot cache tasks
    (unlike TidyAll)
  * supports incremental linting
    (unlike lefthook, husky, lint-staged or overcommit)
 .
